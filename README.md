# Overview

ringpop is an embeddable module (and optional server) that allows applications
to operate within a distributed, consistent hash ring. Ringpop automatically
detects failure of nodes within the ring and disseminates information about the
state of the ring over a gossip protocol (see SWIM).

# Running ringpop

To run ringpop as a standalone server, run `main.js`. Its usage is as follows:

```
Usage: main [options]

  Options:

    -h, --help             output usage information
    -V, --version          output the version number
    -l, --listen <listen>  Host and port on which server listens (also node's identity in cluster)
    -h, --hosts <hosts>    Seed file of list of hosts to join
```

# Developing with ringpop

Instantiate ringpop by providing it the title and listening address of your
application. It's important to note that the listening address of your ringpop
instance is also used as a globally unique identifier for the instance within
the ring. Therefore, make sure `hostPort` is unique.

```javascript
var ringpop = new RingPop({
    app: 'myapp',
    hostPort: 'myhost:30000'
});
```

Then bootstrap ringpop. ringpop will look for a hosts file (see 'Generate hosts
file' section) in `/etc/uber/ringpop/hosts/<app>.json` or `./hosts.json` to
seed the ring and attempt to join a number of the nodes listed therein.

```javascript
ringpop.bootstrap();
```

When ringpop has joined enough nodes, it will be ready for use and emit a
`ready` event. Applications should refuse requests until ringpop is ready.

```javascript
ringpop.on('ready', function() {
    // do something
});
```

Applications can call ringpop's `lookup` function to discover which node a key
hashes to. If the key hashes to the same node performing the lookup, then that
node is free to process the incoming request. Otherwise, applications must
forward the request to the resulting node.

```javascript
var node = ringpop.lookup('cba8e0bf-412f-4edd-b842-882a361a5a7f');

if (node === ringpop.whoami()) {
    // process request
} else {
    // forward request
}
```

The state of the hash ring will change when nodes join, leave, fail or are
revived. When ringpop detects a change, it will emit a `changed` event. A
change in the ring may cause keys to rebalance. If your application is affected
to rebalanced keys, then it is left up to your application to respond
accordingly.

```javascript
ringpop.on('changed', function() {
    // do something
});
```

# Forwarding a request

Ringpop will typically be used by handing over request routing to it. As
described earlier, the "process or forward" pattern is used to decide whether a
request should be processed by the node that received the request or by another
node. As an alternative, `handleOrForward` can be used to encapsulate that
repetitive pattern. Here's an example of its use:

```javascript
// Let's say this is an endpoint handler in your web application
function endpoint(incoming, opts, cb) {
    function handle() {
        // process request
    }

    function forwarded(err, resp, body) {
        cb(err, {
            statusCode: resp && resp.statusCode
        });
    }

    var requestToForward = {
        method: 'POST',
        path: '/supply/1',
        headers: { 'Content-Type: application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({ /* fill body here */ }),
        timeout: 1000
    };

    ringpop.handleOrForward(incoming.params.uuid, handle, requestToForward, forwarded);
}
```

# Generate hosts file

Ringpop uses a hosts file to seed its ring. To generate a hosts file use the
`generate-hosts` script:

```
./scripts/generate-hosts.js --hosts=myhost --base-port=30000 --num-ports=5 --output-file=/etc/ringpop/hosts/project.json
```

### Extensions

# Dependencies
* `logger`
* `statsd`

# Stats

ringpop emits stats using the `statsd` client provided to its constructor. All
stats listed below are relative to a `ringpop.<hostPort>` prefix.

## Counts

These counts are emitted when:

* `full-sync` - the full membership state is disseminated during gossip
* `join.recv` - a join request is received
* `membership-update.alive` - a member becomes alive
* `membership-update.faulty` - a member becomes faulty
* `membership-update.new` - a new member is added
* `membership-update.suspect` - a member becomes suspect
* `ping.recv` - a ping is received
* `ping.send` - a ping is sent
* `ping-req.recv` - a ping-req is received
* `ping-req.send` - a ping is sent

## Gauges

These gauges represent:

* `changes.apply` - number of changes applied when disseminated during gossip
* `changes.disseminate` - number of changes to disseminate during gossip
* `checksum` - the membership checksum (recomputed after membership change)
* `max-piggyback` - max number of times a change is disseminated during gossip
* `num-members` - number of members in membership (emitted when membership is
  updated)

## Timers

These timers measure:

* `compute-checksum` - time it takes to compute checksum
* `ping` - response times of a ping
* `ping-req` - response times of a ping-req
* `ping-req-ping` - response times of a ping sent in response to a ping-req
  received
* `protocol-delay` - the expected delay of the protocol period
* `protocol-frequency` - the actual delay of the protocol period taking into
  account gossip response times

# API

## Properties

* `isReady` - A boolean flag used to indicate whether ringpop is ready. This
  property should be considered read-only.
* `joinSize` - The number of nodes that must be joined during bootstrap before
  ringpop is ready. This should be modified before calling bootstrap in order
  for the mutation to be of any use. Default is `3`.

All other properties should be considered private. Any mutation of properties
not listed above will result in undefined behavior.

## Functions

* `bootstrap()` - Seeds the hash ring, joins nodes in the seed list and starts
  the gossip protocol
* `handleOrForward(key, handle, requestToForward, forwarded)` - Invokes the
  handle function if the provided key hashes to the same destination, otherwise
  forwards the request to that destination
* `lookup(key)` - Returns the node to which the key hashes
* `whoami()` - Returns the address of the running node

## Events

* `ready` - Ringpop is ready
* `changed` - Ring state has changed

## Installation

`npm install ringpop`

## Tests

`npm test`
